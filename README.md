# Database Management System Implementation

## This is a Database Management System that I built using C#, that can be used to perform various SQL Operations

The application is used for grading students in our university.
We manage everything related to a DBMS. We check and update the DB Catalog accordingly for each DDL operation, saving the complete structure of each database, table, index and relations between tables. It also offers most DML operations, up to joins. 
Everything is done through an user interface.
